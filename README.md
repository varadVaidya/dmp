# Obstacle Avoidance using Dynamic Movement Primitives

This project explores the concept of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), its extensions to encode Orientations and to avoid single and multiple
point-like obstacles. 

This paper is an mixed implementation of the following papers:

1. [Dynamical Movement Primitives: Learning Attractor Models for Motor Behaviors](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2824078_Dynamical_Movement_Primitives_Learning_Attractor_Models_for_Motor_Behaviors)

2. [Orientation in Cartesian space dynamic movement primitives](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6907291)

3. [Movement reproduction and obstacle avoidance with dynamic movement primitives and potential fields](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4755937)
